# Shadowban Bot
Twitter bot to query the [shadowban.eu](https://shadowban.eu) API and post a Tweet to each user in the `users.txt` file with their current status. Users would be manually added through a Google Form.

## This bot is no longer in operation. I'm simply keeping the code around here for safekeeping purposes, and with the hope that it could help somebody one day.
Please note that I haven't tested the code since roughly May 2020, so it may not work at all.
